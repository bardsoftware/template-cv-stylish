Stylish CV and Cover Letter

Original description:
This CV template features a stylish header and footer which include your name and contact information. Work experience and education are housed in custom gray boxes which, along with the large header and footer, instantly draw the eyes of the reader to the most important information in the CV. The template is just one page suitable for a recent graduate, but can be expanded to several pages for a longer CV. This CV is the companion to this cover letter.

This stylish cover letter includes a custom large header and footer. The 'To' address is placed so as to show up in a windowed envelope. Unfortunately these do not leave much space for text but there are several ways of increasing available space described in the template.

Important notes: this template needs to be compiled with XeLaTeX. There should be a setting in your LaTeX distribution to change to XeLaTeX. This template also uses a font (Adobe Garamond Pro) which is not distributed with Windows or Linux by default. This will need to be changed to an available font for the template to compile.
